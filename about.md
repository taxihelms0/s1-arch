In 2014 S1 was created by Felisha Ledesma, Alex Ian Smith, and Erik Carlson, serving as co-directors. Erik Carlson left the organization in early 2017. In 2019 Felisha Ledesma and Alex Ian Smith stepped down as co-directors while the project continued under new collective leadership.


This site attempts to serve as a semi-comprehensive archive of the numerous events and ephemera from the first 5 years while S1 was led by its founders. Some things are incomplete. Other things never got documented in the first place.
